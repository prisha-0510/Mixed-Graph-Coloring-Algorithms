# Mixed Graph Coloring Algorithms

This repository presents our work on solving the **Graph Coloring Problem (GCP)** using learning-based methods, graph-theoretic heuristics, and novel modeling strategies, particularly in the context of **mixed graphs**.

## Highlights of This Work

1. **Learning-Based Independent Set Extraction**  
   We explore a range of algorithmic techniques that rely on repeated extraction of independent sets using **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**. These methods serve as the foundation for building color classes and ultimately solving the Graph Coloring Problem effectively.

2. **Real-World Applications via Mixed Graph Modeling**  
   We aim to **mathematically model practical problems** such as **Quantum Circuit Depth Optimization** as instances of the **Mixed Graph Coloring Problem**, which involves both directed and undirected edge constraints. Our objective is to demonstrate the **effectiveness and generalizability** of our proposed methods in solving such real-world challenges.

3. **Scalable Graph Reduction Techniques**  
   We investigate graph reduction techniques that are critical for handling **large-scale real-world graphs**, which may contain millions of nodes and edges. These reductions are designed to **preserve coloring properties**, ensuring that a proper coloring of the reduced graph corresponds directly to a valid coloring of the original graph.
